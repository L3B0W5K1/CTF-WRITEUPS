- We are given a file named 'warm' which has no file specification
- enter **chmod +x warm** to give it permission to run
- enter **./warm** in order to make it run
- We get the following: **Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!**
- So that is what we do, and we get:
- Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_30e77291}

**yeah buddy!**
