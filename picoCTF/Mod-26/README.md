# Solution

- We are given this string:

    **cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_Ncualgvd}**

- And we are given a hint, something about ROT13
- ROT13 converts every letter 13 index-jumps later in the alphabet (not ASCII)
- the python script in the folder converts the string into the flag
