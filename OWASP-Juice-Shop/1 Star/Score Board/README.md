# Solution

we want to find the score board page for the website, we could just guess urls but thats not going to teach us anything

- we open up inspect page
- navigate to sources tab and look through the javascript by searching for keyword **score**
- file **main.js** had a line that said **path: "score-board"**
- we change the url to http://localhost:3000/#/score-board

first task solved

# Takeaways

- javascript files can reveal different pages on a website
